# Basic Banking System

This Repository showcases my project, that I've created for my Internship task at The Sparks Foundation.

I'm hosting this project at Heroku.
Only PC view is available for now. <br>
Go to http://basicbanksystem.kitchenqube.com to see this project live.

## How to start:

1. Clone my repository or download the zip file
2. If you're downloading the zip file, extract the zip file to a folder
3. Create the database first (like i.e bank).
4. Import the Database (MySQL file i.e bank.sql).
5. Open the folder with a code editor like VS Code or any IDE.
6. Update my Config.php file with your database details.
7. Run the code with XAAMP. You can reach out to me for queries. Details in my profile readme.
